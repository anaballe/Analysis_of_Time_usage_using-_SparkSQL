# Analysis_of_Time_usage_using-_SparkSQL
This project is an analysis of time usage using SparkSQL and other Spark APIs 
 It observes how do people allocate their time between these three kinds of activities, and if we can see differences between men and women, employed and unemployed people, and young (less than 22 years old), active (between 22 and 55 years old) and elder people.Also It paves for the following :-
   1)  how much time do we spend on primary needs compared to other activities?
   2)  do women and men spend the same amount of time in working?
   3)  does the time spent on primary needs change when people get older?
   4)  how much time do employed people spend on leisure compared to unemployed people?
  This project makes use of Apache Spark and its parallel computing capabilities over a dataset(A CSV file provided by http://alaska.epfl.ch/~dockermoocs/bigdata/atussum.csv .Concepts of both dataframes and datasets are utilized to solve and see their different rates of efficiency.
